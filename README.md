Various versions of the Packages directory (the main file repository)

H_3.0.255197 is from a late 2012 Mid-Series ICC (no Nav) and is about 70MB

J_3.1.273483 is from an early 2013 High-Series ICC (with Nav) and is about 120MB

Notes: 7-Zip was used to split the zip files (24MB each) and Navigation Database files are zero-length to save space, as they were all old maps and not very useful anymore anyway.
